Status flags:
    carry flag: 1 if there is a carry out of the most significant bit during addition or a borrow during subtraction
    parity flag: 1 if the number of set bits is even
    zero flag: 1 if the result is 0
    sign flag: 1 if the most significant bit is 1 otherwise 0
    auxiliary carry flag: 1 if there is a carry from the 3rd to 4th bit
    overflow flag: 1 if the result of a signed operation is too large to fit in the destination register leading to an incorrect sign

Control flags:
    trap flag: used for single-stepping through a program for debugging.
    interrupt flag: controls wheather the cpu will respond to maskable interrupts
    Direction flag: determines the direction of stirnsg operation

  CF=1 (THERE IS A CARRY OUT IN MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT)
  PF=0 (odd number of bits(5) in AL)
  ZF=0 (the result is non zero)
  SF=0 (most significant bit value)
  OF=1 (the sign changes cause of carry flag)
